# OverTheWireCTF_Bandit
Tracking progress while playing Bandit at OverTheWire.org

# Rationale
I'm very new to UNIX and shell scripting. I spent quite some time looking for a hands-on introduction that would not involve me creating unnecessary files and folders on a completely new distro like most of the tutorials out there. While searching for CTFs to get my hands dirty in security, I've stumbled upon http://www.overthewire.org. Once I started playing the Bandit levels, I found that this was a good way for me to kill two birds with one stone.

Now that I have finished all the levels, I figured I need to go back and document all the steps that I have taken to solidify the learning experience. I know there are tons of blogs and GitHub repos doing that out there and this one is no different.
